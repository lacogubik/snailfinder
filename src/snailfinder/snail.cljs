  {:s1 {:name "Abida secale (Draparnaud, 1833)" :common-name "Large Chrysalis Snail" :family "Chondrinidae" :size "6.0 – 8.5 x 2.3 – 2.8 mm" :image "" :identification-characters "The shell is a conical cylinder, with a distinctively thickened mouth lip. The mouth also contains about 9 angular, prominent lamella-like teeth. The shell is brown with regular fine ribbing." :similar-species "This is the only British Chondrinid and there are no similar species in Britain and Ireland." :ecology "Rocks and screes, dry grasslands, open woodland; always found in limestone areas" :gb-distribution "England (as far north as Cumbria)." :world-distribution "Western European and Alpine, widespread but local in France, Belgium, Switzerland and southern and central Germany." :conservation-status "Included in the IUCN Red List as 'least concern'" :map-image "" :notes ""}
   :s2 {:name "Acicula fusca (Montagu, 1803)" :common-name "Point Snail" :family "Aciculidae" :size "2.2 – 2.5 x 0.8 mm" :image "" :identification-characters "Acicula fusca is a very small species of land snail with an almost straight-sided pointed shell. The shell is thin and translucent, pale golden-brown, very glossy and has irregularly-spaced sharply incised vertical grooves. The mouth of the shell is pear-shaped, and it is one of only two British land snails (the other being Pomatias elegans) to possess an operculum, a plate-like cover that fits tightly within the mouth of the shell when the animal is retracted." :similar-species "There are no other species of Acicula in Britain and it is unlikely to be confused with other species." :ecology "Found in damp places, especially ground litter in old deciduous woods or in moss by springs." :gb-distribution "Widespread in Ireland, very local in Britain." :world-distribution "Found in Belgium, NW Germany, France south to the Dordogne and the Basses Pyrénées." :conservation-status "The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species records Acicula fusca as 'least concern', although it is declining in Ireland due to habitat loss and monitoring is recommended. It remains common in areas such as the Pyrenees, and its decline elsewhere is not yet rapid enough for the species to qualify for a threatened category." :map-image "" :notes ""}

   :s4 {:name "Carychium tridentatum (Risso, 1826)" :common-name "Slender Herald Snail" :family "Ellobiidae" :size "1.8 – 2.0 x 0.9 mm" :image "" :identification-characters "" :similar-species "It can be difficult to separate Carychium tridentatum from Carychium minimum." :ecology "More tolerant of drier habitats than Carychium minimum, although the two species are often found together. Common in woods, damp grassland and well-vegetated places generally." :gb-distribution "Common throughout Britain and Ireland." :world-distribution "Found throughout Europe, but absent from northern Scandinavia and Iceland." :conservation-status "" :map-image "" :notes ""}
   :s5 {:name "Pomatias elegans (O.F. Müller, 1774)" :common-name "Land Winkle, Round-mouthed Snail" :family "Pomatiidae" :size "9-11.5 x 13-16mm" :image "" :identification-characters "Pomatias elegans has a thick, conical shell with a distinctive sculpture of spiral and transverse ribs, the spiral ribbing being the most pronounced. Shell colour varies from pale greyish-purple to yellowish-beige. The mouth of the shell is circular, and it is one of only two British land snails (the other being Acicula fusca) to possess an operculum, a plate-like cover that fits tightly within the mouth of the shell when the animal is retracted. The animal has a long, flexible proboscis and the eyes are set at the base of two tentacles. The sole of the foot is divided longitudinally into halves, which are moved independently when crawling. The sexes are separate." :similar-species "There are no other species of Pomatias in Britain and it is unlikely to be confused with other species." :ecology "Found in open woodland, hedgerows, screes and amongst rocks; always in highly calcareous areas, often burrowing into the surface of loose, friable soils." :gb-distribution "Restricted to areas of calcareous bedrock (limestone and chalk) and therefore most common in southern England. Also found in North Wales and southern Ireland (Co. Clare)." :world-distribution "Found across Western Europe and the Mediterranean..." :conservation-status "The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species records Pomatias elegans as 'least concern' due to its wide distribution across Europe. However, it is protected locally where it is threatened by intensive farming, habitat loss and pesticides. The British population has seriously declined in eastern and central England, and it is endangered in Ireland." :map-image "" :notes ""}
   :s6 {:name "Pyramidula pusilla (Vallot, 1801)" :common-name "Rock Snail" :family "Pyramidulidae" :size "1.5 – 2.0 x 3.0 mm" :image "" :identification-characters "Pyramidula pusilla is a very small species of land snail with a top-shaped dark reddish-brown shell; old specimens are often bleached nearly to white. The umbilicus is very broad and deep. Growth-ridges are well defined but irregular." :similar-species "This species is unlikely to be confused with other species." :ecology "Found on dry limestone rocks and walls fully exposed to the sun, hiding in crevices and emerging in damp weather to feed on lichens." :gb-distribution "Common in most limestone areas of Britain and Ireland. Populations are also known where large limestone blocks have been transported, such as the rockeries in the Cambridge Botanic Garden." :world-distribution "Found across the Mediterranean and western Europe." :conservation-status "" :map-image "" :notes ""}
   :s7 {:name "Truncatellina callicratis (Scacchi, 1833)" :common-name "British Whorl Snail" :family "Vertiginidae" :size "1.8 - 2.0 x 0.9mm" :image "" :identification-characters "The shell is very similar to T. cylindrica, with an even more perfectly cylindrical outline; whorls slightly more convex and suture correspondingly deeper. Three denticles (teeth) are usually present, only one of which is visible in frontal view. However, the teeth may be reduced or even absent, making it difficult to separate from T. cylindrica." :similar-species "The other species of Truncatellina known in Britain, T. cylindrica, has no teeth." :ecology "Found in very dry, calcareous grassy places, open rocky hillsides" :gb-distribution "Found along the south coast of England from Devon to the Isle of Wight." :world-distribution "Common in the French and Swiss alps, Pyrenees and Dordogne." :conservation-status "" :map-image "" :notes ""}
   :s8 {:name "Truncatellina cylindrica (Férussac, 1807)" :common-name "Cylindrical Whorl Snail" :family "Vertiginidae" :size "1.8 – 2.0 x 0.9 mm" :image "" :identification-characters "The shell is almost cylindrical, with a domed apex. The mouth contains no teeth; the mouth edge is slightly thickened. The shell is pale golden-brown with numerous fine and evenly spaced transverse ribs, giving a sparkling appearance at low magnification." :similar-species "The other species of Truncatellina known in Britain, T. callicratis, usually has three teeth. Only one of these is usually visible in frontal view, and they may be reduced or even absent, making this species difficult to separate from T. cylindrica." :ecology "Found in very dry, calcareous grassy places, screes, amongst rocks and occasionally on sand dunes." :gb-distribution "Found in only a few very localized areas in the UK, in Bedfordshire, Yorkshire and Norfolk." :world-distribution "Widespread, but always localized, in southern and western Europe." :conservation-status "The Joint Nature Conservancy Council (JNCC) list Truncatellina cylindrica as a UK priority species owing to its marked decline in the UK." :map-image "" :notes ""}})
